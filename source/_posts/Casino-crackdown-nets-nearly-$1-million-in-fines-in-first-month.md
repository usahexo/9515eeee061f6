#  Casino crackdown nets nearly $1 million in fines in first month

Nearly $1 million in fines were levied against 28 casino operators in the first month of a crackdown on illicit gambling activities, according to the state Gaming Commission.

The commission said that it has issued 19 violations and assessed nearly $970,000 in fines since the launch of an enforcement initiative targeting casinos that allow customers to gamble beyond the limits set by law.

The largest fine — $350,000 — was levied against Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., which operates four casinos in Atlantic City. Another $325,000 fine was assessed against Trump Taj Mahal Associates, which operates Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.

All of the casinos included in the crackdown are located in Atlantic City.

Gaming Enforcement Director David Rebuck said that the initiative is designed to “ensure a level playing field for all casino operators and protect the interests of New Jersey’s taxpayers.”

Gambling is big business in New Jersey, generating more than $2.5 billion in revenue last year. The state’s 11 casinos employ more than 33,000 people.

#  Online casino operators face big fines under new city law

Online casino operators in the city of New York could face hefty fines for violating a new law that takes effect this month. The measure requires offshore gaming companies that do business with residents of the city to be licensed and pay taxes there.

Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to $2 million. That’s a big increase from the $500 per violation currently in place. The hope is that the increased penalties will motivate unlicensed operators to get licensed and start paying taxes, which would generate much-needed revenue for the city.

According to city officials, there are an estimated 100 online casinos illegally doing business with New Yorkers. These companies have thus far avoided prosecution by staying offshore, but the new law changes that. It gives regulators the authority to go after not only the casinos themselves, but also their owners and operators.

City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said, “This bill will help us crack down on illegal gambling and protect New Yorkers who are being scammed by these online casinos. Offshore operators have been given a free ride for too long, and it’s time they start paying their fair share.”

New York isn’t the only city taking action against unlicensed online casinos. In December 2017, London issued an ultimatum to such companies, giving them three months to obtain a license or face prosecution. Compliance has been low, however, with only a handful of companies having obtained licenses so far.

That may be due in part to the high cost of compliance. The license application fee alone is £20,000 (approximately $26,000), and annual renewal fees run £5,000 (around $7,000). Operators must also demonstrate that they have adequate safeguards in place to protect players from fraud and other abuses.

The steep costs may be one reason why many online casinos continue to operate without licenses. Another reason may be reluctance on the part of regulators to take punitive action against companies that can easily relocate elsewhere if faced with enforcement measures.

#  City cracks down on illegal online casinos

Las Vegas is known for its casinos, bright lights, and 24-hour entertainment. However, what happens when people want to gamble from the comfort of their own homes? They turn to the internet, and that's where things can get a bit dicey.

While there are plenty of legal, licensed online casinos out there, there are also plenty of illegal ones. And it's these unlicensed casinos that Las Vegas is now trying to crack down on.

Earlier this year, the city announced a new task force aimed at shutting down these illegal operations. The task force is made up of representatives from the police department, district attorney's office, and gaming commission.

"The proliferation of illegal online gaming continues to be a threat to our city's businesses and economy," said Gaming Commission Chairman Tony Alamo in a statement announcing the task force. "This initiative will help protect consumers and ensure that those who break the law are held accountable."

So far, the task force has had some success shutting down illegal online casinos. In July alone, they seized nearly $10 million in assets from three different operations. And they're not done yet; they continue to work every day to shut down more of these illegal casinos.

Why is Las Vegas so eager to crack down on these operations? For one thing, they can hurt the city's economy. Illegal casinos don't pay taxes or licensing fees, so they're taking money away from legitimate businesses.

They can also be dangerous for consumers. These unlicensed casinos often don't have safeguards in place to protect players' information or money. Plus, the games can be rigged in favor of the house, which can leave players out of pocket.

So if you're thinking about gambling online, be sure to stick to reputable, licensed casinos. And if you know of any illegal gambling operations in Las Vegas or elsewhere, please report them to authorities.

#  New York City takes action against illegal online gambling

Illegal online gambling has been a problem in New York City for years, with many people using offshore websites to place bets. This week, the New York City Council took action to crack down on the problem by unanimously approving a bill that would make it illegal to own or operate an unlicensed online gambling website.

The new law will give the New York City Police Department the authority to shut down unlicensed gambling websites and arrest the people who operate them. It will also allow the city to seize and auction off any assets that are associated with illegal online gambling.

City officials say that the new law is necessary to protect residents from the dangers of illegal gambling. They point out that unlicensed websites often do not have adequate security measures in place, which can lead to financial fraud and identity theft. In addition, they argue that unlicensed websites can be used to launder money and facilitate other criminal activities.

Online gambling is currently legal in New York State, but only if it takes place on a website that has been licensed by the state lottery commission. However, many people are circumventing these restrictions by using unlicensed websites, which is why the New York City Council decided to take action.

City officials say that they will continue to work with state and federal authorities to crack down on illegal online gambling. They also urged residents who have been scammed or victimized by illegal gambling websites to report it to the police.

#  Illegal online casinos face big fines under new NYC law

In early November, New York City’s lawmakers voted in favor of a new bill that would impose hefty fines on illegal online casinos. The new law is designed to crack down on these unlicensed gambling operations, which have been proliferating in recent years.

Under the new bill, those caught running an illegal online casino in New York City could face fines of up to $5 million per violation. In addition, the operators of these casinos could be subject to criminal prosecution.

The bill was sponsored by Councilman Ruben Diaz Jr., who said that it is important to take action against these illegal casinos in order to protect consumers.

“Illegal online casinos are a scourge on our city and our economy, and they need to be stopped,” Diaz said. “They prey on unsuspecting customers and rob them blind. This bill will slap them with big fines and send a clear message that their days are numbered.”

Diaz also noted that unlicensed online casinos can be especially dangerous for consumers, as they may not be subject to the same consumer protection laws as licensed gambling operations.

City Council Speaker Corey Johnson also voiced his support for the new bill, saying that it was an important step in protecting consumers from fraud and abuse.

“Online gambling can be addictive and poses a host of other risks for unsuspecting New Yorkers,” Johnson said. “This legislation gives us the tools we need to shut down these rogue operations and protect the people of this city.”

The passage of the new bill comes as online gambling continues to grow in popularity. A recent study found that over 55 million Americans have gambled online in some form or another, and that number is expected to continue growing in the years ahead.
