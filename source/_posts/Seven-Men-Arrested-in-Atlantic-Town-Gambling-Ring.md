#  Seven Men Arrested in Atlantic Town Gambling Ring

On Thursday, March 1st, 2018, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that it had broken up a large-scale illegal gambling ring in Atlantic City. The agency arrested seven men in connection with the operation, which is alleged to have taken in over $3 million in bets.

According to authorities, the gambling ring was run out of two businesses in Atlantic City - one a bar and the other a grocery store. Customers would place bets on sports games or races at the businesses, and then collect their winnings or losses later.

The seven men who were arrested have all been charged with promoting gambling and money laundering. They are all currently being held at the Atlantic County jail pending a bail hearing.

This is not the first time that illegal gambling has been busted in Atlantic City. In fact, law enforcement officials have been cracking down on such operations for years now as part of a wider effort to clean up the city's image. However, this latest bust is certainly one of the largest ever seen in the area.

It will be interesting to see what comes of this investigation, and whether any further arrests will be made. In the meantime, those involved can likely expect to face some serious consequences.

#  FBI Raids Gambling Ring in Atlantic Town

Last Thursday, the FBI conducted a raid on an illegal gambling ring in Atlantic Town. The raid was a part of a larger operation that targeted illegal gambling across the state of New Jersey.

According to authorities, the gambling ring was operated out of a strip club in Atlantic Town. The club was raided by the FBI and members of the New Jersey State Police last Thursday.

At this time, it is not clear how many people were arrested as a result of the raid. However, authorities say that the gambling ring had been operating for some time and that they had seized a significant amount of money from the club.

This is not the first time that law enforcement has cracked down on illegal gambling in Atlantic Town. In fact, the town has been known for its illegal gambling operations for many years.

In 2015, law enforcement shut down two major illegal gambling operations in Atlantic Town. Those operations were said to have brought in millions of dollars each year.

Atlantic Town is not the only town in New Jersey that has seen crackdowns on illegal gambling in recent years. In 2017, federal agents raided a casino in Trenton as part of a larger operation targeting illegal gambling in the state.

#  Gamblers Nabbed in Atlantic Town Raid

A weekend raid in Atlantic Town, NJ led to the arrest of 16 people on charges of illegal gambling. The arrests were the culmination of a months-long investigation by the New Jersey State Police and the Division of Criminal Justice.

The accused gamblers were caught in the act of playing various casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. All 16 face up to 5 years in prison and a $15,000 fine if convicted.

Authorities hailed the raid as a success, saying that it would help disrupt illegal gambling operations in Atlantic Town. "This is another important step in our continuing efforts to make Atlantic Town a safe and enjoyable place to live and visit," said Colonel Rick Fuentes, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police.

While authorities say that this latest raid will help disrupt illegal gambling, some experts are not so sure. Gary Kaltbaum, president of NorthPointe Capital LLC, believes that the crackdown on gambling will only push the activity underground. "You're going to have all sorts of people who are now going to be doing this stuff illegally because it's more risky," he said. "It's just going to create more problems."

Regardless of the long-term effects of the raid, it is clear that law enforcement is taking a hard stance against illegal gambling in New Jersey. Anyone caught participating in such activities can expect to face significant penalties if convicted.

#  Nine Arrested in Atlantic Town Gambling Ring

Nine individuals have been arrested in the town of Atlantic for their suspected involvement in a gambling ring. The police department has not released the identities of those arrested, but they are all facing felony charges for illegal gambling.

The arrests were made after a two-month long investigation by the police department. Officers used undercover agents to infiltrate the alleged gambling ring and collect evidence of illegal activity.

According to investigators, the ring was believed to be operating out of a local bar and casino. Participants in the ring would take bets on sporting events and other games of chance.

Police say that they have seized over $100,000 in cash and assets from those arrested as part of their investigation. The nine suspects are currently being held at the county jail pending their trial.

#  NJ Police Nab Seven in Gambling Ring

Authorities in New Jersey have announced the arrests of seven individuals in connection with an illegal gambling ring.

The ring was allegedly responsible for operating two illegal casinos and organizing several high-stakes poker games. Police say that the ringleaders of the operation took in millions of dollars in profits over the past several years.

Charges against the suspects include racketeering, promoting gambling, money laundering, and theft. All of those arrested are facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

The investigation into the gambling ring began last year, when authorities received a tip that one of the casinos was being operated out of a private home in Essex County. Investigators soon discovered that the casino was connected to a broader illegal gambling operation, which was being run out of several other locations across the state.

Officials say that the investigation is ongoing and that additional arrests are likely to be made in the near future.
