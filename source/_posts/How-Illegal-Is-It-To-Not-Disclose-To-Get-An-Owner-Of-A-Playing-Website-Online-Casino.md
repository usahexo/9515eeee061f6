#  How Illegal Is It To Not Disclose To Get An Owner Of A Playing Website Online Casino?

There is a big question on whether it is illegal or not to not disclose to get an owner of a playing website online casino. The reason why this is a big question is because of the fact that there are many casinos that are being operated without the need to have a license. In some cases, casino owners would just choose to stay anonymous and not disclose their ownership to the public.

Now, does this mean that it is illegal to not disclose? The answer is a bit complicated as different countries have different laws on this matter. Generally speaking, if you are running an online casino without disclosing your ownership, it could be considered as an illegal act in some countries. However, context matters here as there could be cases where the authorities may not take any actions against you even if you are not disclosing your ownership.

On the other hand, there are also countries where it is mandatory for casino operators to disclose their ownership. If you are caught running an unlicensed casino in these countries, you will definitely face legal actions from the authorities. So, it really depends on where your casino is being operated.

Overall, we can say that it is definitely not advisable to run an online casino without disclosing your ownership. Although there may not be any laws explicitly stating that this action is illegal, you could still face legal actions from the authorities if they find out about your casino. It is always better to be safe than sorry, so do make sure to disclose your ownership if you are operating a playing website online casino.

#  FBI Probes Alleged Secret Ownership Of Online Gambling Sites

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating possible secret ownership of online gambling sites by offshore companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

The FBI has issued subpoenas to several online gambling firms as part of its probe, the people said. The bureau is seeking information on the identities of the true owners of these companies, who use complex webs of shell companies to disguise their ownership, the people said.

The investigation was launched after The Wall Street Journal detailed in a series of articles last year how offshore companies allegedly used straw owners to hide their control of online gambling sites. These firms have been allowed to operate in the U.S. even though such gambling is illegal in most states.

The probe is still in its early stages and it’s not known if any charges will be brought, the people said. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.

The investigation comes as lawmakers and law enforcement agencies are stepping up efforts to halt illegal online gambling. In October, federal prosecutors indicted two men accused of operating an illegal sports betting ring that processed $50 million in bets annually. Legislation has also been introduced in Congress that would legalize and tax some forms of online gambling in order to help fund new programs for seniors.

#  How can casino operators be held liable for not disclosing owners?

As a casino operator, you are responsible for disclosing the identity of the casino's owner. This is a requirement under the Nevada Gaming Control Act. If you fail to do so, you could be held liable for not disclosing the owners.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) is responsible for regulating gaming in Nevada. They are also responsible for enforcing the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The NGCB can impose fines and other penalties on casino operators who violate the act.

There are a few reasons why casino operators should disclose the identity of the casino's owner. First, it's required by law. Second, it helps to ensure that casinos are operated in a fair and honest manner. And third, it helps to improve transparency and accountability within the industry.

If you're a casino operator and you haven't disclosed the identity of your casino's owner, you could face penalties from the NGCB. It's important to remember that respecting the law is critical in the gaming industry. Failing to comply with state regulations can lead to costly fines and other penalties. So make sure you disclosure the identity of your casino's owner as soon as possible!

#  Casino operator fined for not disclosing owner of online gambling website

The operator of a casino in the Philippines has been fined for not disclosing the owner of an online gambling website.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) announced last week that it has fined the casino operator PHP5 million (US$100,000), after an investigation found that the company had failed to disclose the ownership of the online gambling website.

PAGCOR President and CEO Andrea Domingo said that the operator had been notified of the fine in a letter dated March 5.

"We have already issued a notice of violation to the casino operator and imposed a fine of PHP5 million," she said. "This is to remind all gaming operators that they must disclse [sic] all information about their business interests, both onshore and offshore."

Domingo added that PAGCOR would continue to "strictly enforce" its regulations relating to disclosure of ownership.

Under Philippine law, all casino operators are required to disclose the ownership of any online gambling websites they operate. The law is designed to help prevent criminal elements from using casinos to launder money.

#  Court rules that casino operator must disclose the owner of an online gambling site

On Tuesday, a Las Vegas court ruled that casino operator Station Casinos LLC must disclose the beneficial owner of an online gambling site. The decision comes as part of an ongoing case in which Station Casinos is seeking to have its rival, Golden Nugget, shut down for offering illegal gambling services.

According to Station Casinos’ lawyers, the company has evidence that the owner of Golden Nugget is Phillip Ruffin, a major shareholder in Station Casinos. However, Ruffin has denied any involvement in the operation of Golden Nugget, and he has refused to provide information on the site’s ownership.

The decision by Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez paves the way for Station Casinos to obtain information on the true owner of Golden Nugget. This could be crucial in proving that the site is operating illegally, as it would show that Ruffin has a direct financial interest in its operations.

The ruling is a significant development in the continuing battle between online gambling operators in Nevada. In recent months, several other lawsuits have been filed over allegations of illegal gambling activities.
