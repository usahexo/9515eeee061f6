Megadice is the perfect game for all dice enthusiasts. With its simple gameplay and fast-paced action, Megadice is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

The objective of Megadice is to move your character up the board, accumulating wealth and avoiding traps along the way. The game board is split into 100 squares, with each square representing a different event. The squares are numbered 1-100, and each player must start at square 1 and work their way up to square 100.

At the beginning of the game, each player is given 3 lives. If you lose all of your lives, then you lose the game. The aim of the game is to reach square 100 while amassing as much wealth as possible. Wealth can be gained by landing on certain squares, or by picking it up from other players who have landed on “Bank” squares.

However, players must be careful not to land on any “Trap” squares, as these will cause them to lose wealth or even lose a life! The game board is full of traps, and it’s important to know where they are before you start playing.

#  The ultimate gambling game - Snakes and Ladders Megadice!

## History of Snakes and Ladders

The popular board game Snakes and Ladders was created in India in the first century BC. The game was known as "Moksha Patam" and represented a journey to salvation. The ladders represented virtues such as wisdom, courage, and power while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, and greed.

The modern version of the game was created in England in the 1800s. It was called "Pachisi" and was similar to the modern game but with more squares on the board. In 1943, the name of the game was changed to "Snakes and Ladders" and it became popular in America.

## The Gameplay of Snakes and Ladders Megadice!

Snakes and Ladders Megadice is a gambling game that can be played by 2-6 players. The object of the game is to reach the finish square (100) before your opponents do. Players must roll dice to move their players along the board. If a player lands on a snake, they must roll again and subtract the number of circles shown on the die from their current score; if they land on a ladder, they must roll again and add the number of circles shown on the die to their current score. The first player to reach 100 or more is declared the winner.
