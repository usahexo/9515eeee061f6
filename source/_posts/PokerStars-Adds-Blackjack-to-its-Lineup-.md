#  PokerStars Adds Blackjack to its Lineup 

The world's largest online poker site, PokerStars, has announced that it is adding blackjack to its lineup of games. The game will be available in both real-money and play money variants.

"We're always looking for new ways to excite our players and blackjack is a game that we know is popular with poker players," said Severin Rasset, Director of Poker Innovation and Operations at PokerStars. "We believe that the addition of blackjack to our portfolio of games will create even more excitement for our players."

Blackjack is a popular card game that is typically played against the house. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting as close to 21 as possible, or by having a higher total than the dealer without going over 21.

PokerStars' blackjack offering will include a range of betting options, including multi-hand and high roller tables. There will also be a variety of Side Bets available, such as Perfect Pairs and 21+3.

#  Get a Perfect Hand in Blackjack with These Tips 

Most people think that playing blackjack is all about chance and luck. While it is true that Lady Luck has a hand in the game, there are things that you can do to tilt the odds in your favor. By following these simple tips, you can get a perfect hand in blackjack and come out a winner every time!

Tip #1: Know the Rules of the Game

Before you sit down at a blackjack table, take some time to learn the rules of the game. There is nothing more frustrating than losing because you don’t understand what is going on. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player with the highest total wins the hand. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what is most advantageous for the player.

Tip #2: Choose Your Table Wisely

Not all blackjack tables are created equal. Before choosing a table, take a moment to assess your odds. The higher the minimum bet at a table, the better your chances of winning will be. If you are just starting out, it might be best to avoid high-roller tables and stick to ones with lower minimums. That way, you won’t lose your entire bankroll before you even get started.

Tip #3: Stick to Basic Strategy

One of the biggest mistakes that novice players make is trying to outsmart the casino by making silly bets. This only leads to disaster in the long run. Instead of betting on complex strategies, stick to basic strategy which has been proven to work time and again. Basic strategy takes into account your cards and the dealer’s cards, and tells you what bets to make in order to increase your chances of winning.

Tip #4: Use Banking Blackjack Strategies

If you want an even bigger edge over the casino, consider using banking blackjack strategies. These systems incorporate card counting techniques in order to give you an advantage over the house. While mastering card counting may take some time and practice, it is well worth it in the long run. For more information on banking blackjack strategies, simply Google “card counting tutorial” or “banking blackjack strategy pdf” and you will find plenty of helpful resources online.

With these tips under your belt, you are ready to take on the casinos and win big! So put on your lucky shirt and head out to try your luck at blackjack – you might be surprised at how well you do!

#  How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro 

If you're looking to up your blackjack game, look no further. We've put together a few tips to help make you a pro at the casino table.

1. Know Your Hand

One of the most important things to understand about blackjack is how to read your hand. Your hand will consist of two cards - your face card and your number card. The value of these cards will determine your point total. The ace can be either 1 or 11, depending on what makes the game more advantageous for you.

2. Make a Plan

Before you start playing, it's important to have a plan in mind. Decide how much you're willing to lose before you walk away and stick to it. This will help keep you from making rash decisions while playing and prevent you from losing too much money in one sitting.

3. Choose the Right Table

When choosing a blackjack table, it's important to pick one that has lower limits. This way, you won't be risking too much money per bet and you'll have more chances of winning big bucks. Table minimums usually start at $5 so if you're looking to play for high stakes, head to a different table.

4. Play Smart

One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is not to go over 21. If your point total exceeds 21, you automatically lose no matter what your dealer's hand is like. So, play smart and remember that it's better to stand pat than risk going bust.

#  Win at Blackjack Every Time With These Tips 

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and for good reason — it’s a lot of fun, and it’s also one of the easiest games to win at. With some basic strategy, you can increase your chances of walking away a winner every time you play.

The first thing you need to know is how to calculate your odds. This is easy; simply divide your total bet by 21. This will give you your chance of winning on any given hand. So if you bet $5 and are dealt an Ace as your first card, your odds of winning are 4/21, or 19%.

Knowing your odds is essential for making smart decisions while playing blackjack. For example, if the dealer has a 5 showing and you have a 16, you should hit, because your odds of winning are better than the odds of busting (going over 21). Conversely, if you have an Ace and a 6 and the dealer has a 3 showing, you should stand, because the odds of busting are greater than the odds of winning.

Another key factor to consider while playing blackjack is whether to take insurance. This is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack. Generally speaking, you should only take insurance if the odds are in your favour; for example, if you have an Ace and the dealer has a 10 showing, then taking insurance is a good idea because the odds of the dealer having Blackjack are about 1 in 3.

Finally, be careful when doubling down. This is when you double your bet after being dealt two cards, but receive just one additional card. Only do this if both cards add up to nine or more; otherwise, it’s usually better to hit instead.

With these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a blackjack expert!

#  The Best Way to Play Blackjack

There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to play blackjack like a pro. Firstly, always split aces and eights. Secondly, never take insurance. Thirdly, learn when to hit and when to stand.

If you're dealt two aces, always split them. This gives you two opportunities to get another ace and make 21. If you're dealt two eights, again, always split them. This gives you four chances to get another eight and make 16.

Never take insurance. This is basically a bet that the dealer has blackjack, and it's not usually worth it because the odds are against you.

Learn when to hit and when to stand. If your hand totals 17 or more, you should stand. If your hand totals 16 or less, you should hit.
