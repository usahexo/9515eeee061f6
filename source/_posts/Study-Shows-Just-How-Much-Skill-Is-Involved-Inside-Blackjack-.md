A recent study shows that blackjack is more skill than luck. The study was conducted by scientists at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.

The study found that playing blackjack is a skill that can be learned and improved on with practice. Players who took part in the study showed significant improvement in their game play after practicing for just five hours.

The scientists gathered data from 36 different test subjects who were divided into two groups. One group played blackjack only once, while the other group played 10 sessions of blackjack. The results showed that the group who played 10 sessions of blackjack improved their game play significantly more than the group who played only once.

#  Expert Blackjack Players Have Edge Over Amateurs 

Though blackjack might seem like a simple game, it actually involves a fair bit of strategy. Novices often make costly mistakes that give the advantage to experienced players. Here are some of the tips experts use to gain an edge over amateurs:

#1: Know Your Limits

One of the biggest mistakes novice players make is betting too much money. This can lead to reckless playing and costly losses. It’s important to know your limits and stick to them. Decide how much you can afford to lose and never bet more than that amount.

#2: Use Basic Strategy

Another key to winning at blackjack is using basic strategy. This involves making decisions based on the cards you are dealt and the dealer’s upcard. There are charts available online that will help you make the right choices for each hand. If you don’t want to bother with charts, there are also many software programs and apps that will do the work for you.

#3: Count Cards

One of the biggest advantages experts have over novices is their ability to count cards. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played, so you can better anticipate what’s coming next. It takes some practice to become good at counting cards, but it can give you a big edge over the house.

#4: Use a betting System

Another way experts gain an edge is by using betting systems. These systems involve making specific bets based on the size of your bankroll and the odds of winning. There are many different betting systems available, so find one that suits your style and stick with it.

#5: Don’t Get Emotional

One of the biggest mistakes amateur players make is getting emotional about their bets. When you start letting your emotions dictate your play, you become much more likely to make costly mistakes. Keep a clear head and always make decisions based on logic, not emotion.

#  Skills Required To Win At Blackjack 

If you want to be a successful blackjack player, there are certain skills that you will need to master. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important skills required to win at blackjack.

First and foremost, you need to have a good understanding of the game rules. If you are not familiar with the different hands and how they are ranked, you will not be able to make informed decisions during the game. Another important skill is basic strategy. Basic strategy is a set of guidelines that tells you the best way to play each hand, depending on the cards that you are dealt. If you can master basic strategy, you will give yourself a much better chance of winning at blackjack.

In order to win at blackjack, it is also important to be aware of the house advantage and how it affects your odds. The house advantage is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to earn over time. It is important to know where the advantage lies so that you can make informed betting decisions.

Another critical skill for blackjack players is card counting. Card counting allows players to keep track of which cards have been played, which gives them an edge when betting. While card counting can be difficult, it can be very profitable if done correctly.

Finally, it is important to stay calm and focused while playing blackjack. If you become agitated or frustrated, it will only lead to poor decision-making and eventual losses. By keeping a cool head and playing smartly, you can give yourself the best chance of winning at blackjack.
